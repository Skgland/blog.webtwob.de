I wrote a static site generator to revive my Blog
==================================================

I used to have a website that I started writing around 9th grade.
It was written in PHP and allowed one to login and create posts.
That ran on a Raspberry-PI until the SD-Card reached its EOL.
Since then my webpage has claimed **FIXME the page is currently not reachable**,
but it appeared I never had the motivation to fix it.
So this is the long brewing attempt to get something less complex,
but still made by me back up and running again.
Instead of an interactive side a static site generator and
a CI-Pipeline to deploy to Github-Pages shall suffice.
This is the first crudely written Post that I created as a test,
 while I am writing the generator.
